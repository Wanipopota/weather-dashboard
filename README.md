# Weather dashboard

## Description
Server-side APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

Use the 5 Day Weather ForecastLinks to an external site. to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.You will use localStorage to store any persistent data.
